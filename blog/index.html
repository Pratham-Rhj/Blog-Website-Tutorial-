			This blog provides articles on programming tricks, tools, and shortcuts. It has tutorials on C, Java, PHP, Python, and Ruby on Rails. The blog, created in 2011, is designed to help people navigate the world of programming and development tools. The creator of the blog started the site with some basic notes and questions that he gathered in class in college. Apparently, the posts came in high demand by the community, and soon his personal blog turned into the programming review, snippets, and tutorials provider that it is today.

		<p>After a couple of months, all the late nights and lack of sleep are starting to weigh down on you. You bitterly come to the realization that you won’t be anywhere near landing a new job in 6 months. The thought is incredibly discouraging. 
Finally, you decide to take a break– you’re feeling burned out and frankly exhausted. That break extends out for further months.
